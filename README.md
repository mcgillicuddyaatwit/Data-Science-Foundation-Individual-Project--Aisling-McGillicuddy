### Real-Time DDoS Attack Classification and Feature Importance Analysis

This project successfully developed and evaluated machine learning models for the binary classification of network traffic (Normal vs. DDoS) using real-time flow-based features, aiming to create an effective, high-accuracy detection system suitable for real-time deployment. The central research question was: "How accurate and efficient are machine learning models at classifying real-time network traffic as Normal or DDoS using flow-based features, and which features are the most significant indicators of an attack?"The methodology centered on comparing three classification algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and XGBoost, utilizing a non-shuffled temporal train-test split strategy to evaluate performance.The core findings reveal the potential for creating a highly efficient, production-ready solution for low-latency network defense.

### Key Findings and Performance Metrics
Model comparison showed that both the Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved a perfect performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 1.0000 and an F1-score of 1.0 on the test set, demonstrating their ability to perfectly distinguish between the two classes. The simpler Logistic Regression model performed lower, scoring an AUC of approximately 0.81 and an F1-score of approximately 0.78.However, this highly promising result is affected by a significant methodological limitation: the perfect scores are overly optimistic because the dataset strictly segregated Normal traffic from DDoS traffic, preventing the use of a more realistic Time Series Cross-Validation. This perfect classification strongly indicates that the classes were too cleanly separable or that the models overfitted the data, posing a risk of poor generalization on real-world, noisy traffic.

### Feature Importance and Real-Time Feasibility

Analysis of the model's feature importance revealed that the classification heavily relied on just two features: log_packet_count and log_byte_count.This indicates that the models found simple volumetric thresholds sufficient for separation, confirming the attack signature is strongly linear and well-identifiable by simple rate-based features.When assessing real-time feasibility, the Logistic Regression model emerged as the most practical choice due to its exceptionally low computational cost. Despite its lower accuracy score, LR achieved the lowest inference time of only 0.0927 ms per 100, making it the most suitable candidate for implementing a crucial, high-speed machine learning-driven defense layer.


### Conclusion and Future Work

In conclusion, the project validates that a highly efficient production-ready solution can be created based on a few key flow-based features, enabling network security devices to implement a low-latency defense layer.However, the overly optimistic results and reliance on simple volumetric features highlight the need for further validation.Future work must focus on validating the models against a live or real-world stream of traffic to obtain realistic performance measures (expected AUC of 0.80-0.95) and implementing advanced feature engineering to include time-series or flow-level behavioral features, forcing the model to learn more robust, subtle patterns than simple volume counts.
